Interest in running self-hosted media center seedboxes continues to be a popular discussion topic online, due in large part to the continued [enshittification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification) of streaming media services. However, the required level of baseline knowledge creates a relatively high bar for entry. In an effort to democratize this knowledge, this guide details the hardware, software, and steps required to build an entry-level self-hosted media center seedbox. Some foundational technical knowledge is assumed on the part of the user; information more basic than what is provided here is beyond the scope of this guide.

Key features:
* Entry-level: The hardware and software used in this guide were selected to minimize unfamiliar topics, while still resulting in a valuable end product. Users with an interest in doing so can use this as an initial stepping stone to further customize their environment.
* Secure: Bittorrent is bound at the OS-level (in contrast to client-level) to only pass through a VPN, with no risk of DNS/IP leaking.
* Low CapEx: Startup cost is equal to about 4 months of Netflix Premium.
* Low OpEx: Ongoing costs are near-zero.
